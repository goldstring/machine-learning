<center style="text-align:center;margin:0 auto;"><h1>Car Purchase Deicision Classification Using Machine Learning</h1></center>

<h1><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT : </b></h1>
<p> 
 In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning model to classify whether potential car buyers will be able to purchase a car based on their demographic and financial attributes. The dataset comprises details from 1,000 customers, including their gender, age, annual salary, and the corresponding purchase decision (indicated as 0 for 'No' and 1 for 'Yes').
</p>


<h1><b>OBJECTIVE: </b></h1>
<p> 
 To build an accurate classification model that predicts a customer's likelihood of purchasing a car based on their annual salary and demographic factors. The insights gained from this model will assist automotive businesses in targeting the right customers and optimizing their marketing strategies.
</p>


<h1><b>Dataset Overview: </b></h1>
<p>
    <p><strong>User ID:</strong> Unique identifier for each customer.</p>
    <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).</p>
    <p><strong>Age:</strong> Age of the customer in years.</p>
    <p><strong>Annual Salary:</strong> Customer's annual income.</p>
    <p><strong>Purchase Decision:</strong> Target variable indicating if the customer intends to purchase a car (0 = No, 1 = Yes).</p>
 
</p>

<h1><b>Conclusion: </b></h1>
<p> 
 In this study, we developed a machine learning model to classify potential car buyers based on their demographic and financial attributes. By analyzing a dataset of 1,000 customers, we focused on key features such as user ID, gender, age, annual salary, and the target variable indicating the purchase decision.
</p>

<p> 
The results demonstrated that certain demographic factors and income levels significantly influence a customer's likelihood to purchase a car. By successfully classifying customers into those likely to buy a car and those not likely to do so, our model provides valuable insights for automotive businesses.
</p>

<p>
  These insights can assist marketing teams in targeting the right audience, tailoring campaigns to specific demographics, and optimizing resource allocation. Moreover, the findings pave the way for further research into additional factors that may influence purchasing behavior, such as customer preferences and external economic conditions.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, this project highlights the potential of machine learning in enhancing decision-making processes within the automotive industry, leading to improved customer engagement and increased sales.
