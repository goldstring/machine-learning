<h1>Medical Expenses Dataset Overview</h1>
    <h2>What is the dataset about?</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains information about people and their medical expenses (insurance charges). It has factors like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> How old someone is</li>
        <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Gender</li>
        <li><strong>BMI:</strong> Body Mass Index</li>
        <li><strong>Children:</strong> How many children they have</li>
        <li><strong>Smoker:</strong> Whether they smoke or not</li>
        <li><strong>Region:</strong> Where they live</li>
        <li><strong>Charges:</strong> The medical cost or insurance charge</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used to predict how much a new person might pay for medical insurance based on their details.</p>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        <h3>What factors impact medical expenses the most?</h3>
        <p>We want to know which factors, like age or smoking, have the biggest effect on medical costs.</p>
        <h3>How accurate can we predict medical expenses?</h3>
        <p>We will build a machine learning model to predict how much someone will pay based on their data (age, smoking, etc.) and see how accurate the predictions are.</p>
        <h3>How can machine learning help health insurance companies?</h3>
        <p>By making accurate predictions, insurance companies can price policies better and reduce risks, which can help them be more profitable and efficient.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>In Short:</h2>
    <p>The dataset helps us understand which factors influence medical expenses and how machine learning models can predict these expenses accurately to help insurance companies make better decisions.</p>
