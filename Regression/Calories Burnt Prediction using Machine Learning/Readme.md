<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>
        Design and implement a <strong>calories prediction model</strong> to estimate the number of calories burned during physical activities based on demographic, physiological, and activity-related data. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the <strong>calories burned (Calories)</strong> using features such as age, gender, height, weight, activity duration, heart rate, and body temperature. This model can help in personalizing fitness plans and monitoring health.

    <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains information about individuals, their demographic details, physiological measurements, and activity metrics, which can influence the number of calories burned. Below is a description of the dataset:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>User_ID</strong></td>
                <td>Unique identifier for each individual in the dataset.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Calories</strong></td>
                <td>Number of calories burned (target variable for prediction).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Gender</strong></td>
                <td>Gender of the individual (male or female).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Age</strong></td>
                <td>Age of the individual in years.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Height</strong></td>
                <td>Height of the individual in centimeters (cm).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Weight</strong></td>
                <td>Weight of the individual in kilograms (kg).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Duration</strong></td>
                <td>Duration of the physical activity in minutes.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Heart_Rate</strong></td>
                <td>Average heart rate of the individual during the activity (beats per minute).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Body_Temp</strong></td>
                <td>Body temperature of the individual during the activity (in degrees Celsius).</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>Use Case</h2>
    <div class="use-case">
        <p>
            This model can be used in fitness applications to provide real-time feedback on calories burned during activities. It can also help health professionals and trainers design more effective and personalized fitness regimens based on individual characteristics.
